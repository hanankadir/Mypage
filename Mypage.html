    Bio:

    <p>I am from Ethiopia.I love playing soccer.
    I play soccer at school and with my friends.
    Playing soccer give me the chance to have fun.
    <p> I currently  go to Mckinley Technology High School in Washington DC.
    I like to take picture of  nature such as flowers, trees, mountains, and waterfall.<p>

I always have liked soccer.
Such a rough game.
Such skills required.
And popular.
Hometown watching,
on Sunday morning.
When one day,
I found that I needed
to withdraw.
It was the honourable
thing to do.
